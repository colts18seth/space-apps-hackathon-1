# space-apps-hackathon

This app was built for NASA Space Apps 2020. We were tasked with making space data from around the world more accessible. We set out to create an application that would return search results given search queries.

We ultimately delivered an application that displays a list of resources that users can then go to to get specific space data. 

## Future Goals:
- Submission form to add a space resource to the database (form is complete, need to finish logic)
- Filter results by keywords and resource information
- Paginate results from database

## Tech-stack:
Backend: Flask server and postgreSQL database via SQLalchemy  
Frontend: React accessing the Flask API for responses
